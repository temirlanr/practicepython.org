"""
This weekâ€™s exercise is going to be revisiting an
old exercise (see Exercise 5), except require the
solution in a different way.

Take two lists, say for example these two:

	a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
	b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

and write a program that returns a list that contains
only the elements that are common between the lists
(without duplicates). Make sure your program works on
two lists of different sizes. Write this using at least
one list comprehension.
(Hint: Remember list comprehensions from Exercise 7).

Extra:

    Randomly generate two lists to test this

"""

import random

a = []
b = []


def random_list(aa):
    for i in range(0, random.randint(8, 15)):
        n = random.randint(1, 100)
        aa.append(n)
    return aa


random_list(a)
random_list(b)

print(a)
print(b)

temp = [num for num in b if num in a]

print(temp)
